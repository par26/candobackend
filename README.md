## Code Architecture

Our code is organized into three main folders: `controllers`, `models`, and
`routes`. Inside the `controllers` folder, we have files that controls the logic
of the app when it receives a request. Inside the `models` folder, we have files
that contains the data structure for our database. Lastly, inside the `routes`
folder, we have files that provides logic that connects the url request to our
actual controllers.

## Features

Our app includes features such as

- log in/sign up
- adding companies
- editing and deleting company
- viewing company details.
- Inside company details, we have 3D location display using Mapbox API.
